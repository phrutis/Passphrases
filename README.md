The search takes place on the fastest program</br>
[18972](https://allprivatekeys.com/hacked-brainwallets-with-balance) passphrases were found, an estimated 5,000 passphrases are lost</br>
They were found on a processor with a maximum speed of 100,000 characters per second.</br>
Challenge Speed 3090 = 180,000,000/sec. It's 1800 times faster.</br>
The fact that one 3090 GPU runs in 24 hours is a legendary CPU program in 5 years.</br>

How to search for old lost passphrases:</br>
If you have a GPUs:</br>
**RTX 2070, 2080, 2090, 3060, 3070, 3080, 3090, A5000, A6000** and are ready to search for a key **24/7**</br>

If you do not have a 30xx card, you can [**rent**](https://vast.ai) it and participate in a collective search. </br>
For some users, [**renting**](https://vast.ai) is cheaper than searching on their own PC. There is also less noise in the house.</br>
When renting, you must take into account the risk that the key may not be found at all.</br> 
You may incur losses. Think of it not as earnings, but as a lottery.

In the [**TABLE**](https://github.com/phrutis/Passphrases/blob/main/Others/table.md), select a **FREE** range between 1-10000

For GPU 20xx use --bits 18 (24)</br>
-d ? (GPU card number)</br>

RTX A6000 180 Mkey/s = 4 days (one range)</br>
RTX 3090 180 Mkey/s = 4 days (one range)</br>
RTX 3070 120 Mkey/s = 8 days (one range)</br>
RTX 2070 30 Mkey/s = 20 days (one range)</br>
